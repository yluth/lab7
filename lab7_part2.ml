                   Modules and Abstract Data Types
 *)

(* Objective: This lab practices concepts of modules, including files
as modules, signatures, and polymorphic abstract data types.

There are 4 total parts to this lab. Please refer to the following
files to complete all exercises:

   lab7_part1.ml -- Part 1: Implementing modules
-> lab7_part2.ml -- Part 2: Files as modules (this file)
   lab7_part3.ml -- Part 3: Interfaces as abstraction barriers
   lab7_part4.ml -- Part 4: Polymorphic abstract types
 *)

(*======================================================================
Part 2: Files as modules

A useful feature of OCaml is that it *automatically* wraps functions
and values that are defined in a single file into a module named after
that file. The module name is the name of the file with the first
letter capitalized. This functionality is in addition to the manual
definition of modules as you've just used in Part 1, but it is a
convenient way of separating code into separate namespaces when
writing a large program.

There are other source files included in this lab, other than the
lab7_partn.ml files. The file color.ml contains an implementation of a
system for managing colors. (Recall the idea of colors as consisting
of values for three color channels (red, green, and blue) from lab 5.)
Take a look at it to see what functions and values it contains,
including a type for colors, and a means for converting values for the
three color channels into the abstract color type, extracting the
channels individually from colors, and converting some standard color
names to this color representation.

With the exception of Exercise 2A, you will need to modify **only**
color.ml to complete the exercises below.

    A digression on accessing other modules:

    You'll want to test this part of the lab using ocamlbuild, for instance, with

       % ocamlbuild lab7_part2.byte
       % ./lab7_part2.byte

    The ocamlbuild command should automatically find modules that
    you've written in the same directory as your source, compile those
    additional files, and link them to your compiled program. You can
    then access functions from those files under the module name,
    which (again) is the name of the file with the first letter
    capitalized. For instance, if color.ml is in the same directory as
    lab7_part2.ml (which it probably is), ocamlbuild will find it and
    use it, since it is referenced through expressions like
    `Color.red` and the like.

    On the other hand, if you're testing with a top-level REPL, like
    utop or ocaml, it will not automatically find those modules and
    evaluate them for you. However, you can do so manually yourself
    with the #mod_use directive, like this:

        # #mod_use "color.ml" ;;

    allowing you to then refer to elements of the module as, for
    instance,

        # Color.color_named ;;
        - : Color.color_name -> int = <fun>

    (Note the capitalized module name.)

    Keep in mind however that the #mod_use and #use directives look
    only at their argument files, not at any corresponding .mli files,
    so the modules being used will not be restricted to the signatures
    in the corresponding .mli files. For that, you'll have to use the
    compiler (with ocamlbuild for instance).

........................................................................
Exercise 2A: Replace the `0` in the expression below with an
expression that extracts the red channel of the color named Red,
thereby naming the result `red_channel`.
......................................................................*)


let red_channel = 
  let open Color in
  red (color_named Red) ;;

(* Let's investigate one way that a signature can be useful. Although
color.ml contains an implementation of a basic color module, the
implementation is unintuitive and obscure -- truly horrid in fact. (We
did that on purpose.) You will want to change the implementation of
color.ml, rewriting it wholesale. At the same time, you'll want to
guarantee to users of the module (like this file itself!) that the
functionality stays the same; the way to do this is through module
signatures.

......................................................................
Exercise 2B: Add a file color.mli, in which you define an appropriate
signature for the Color module. Consider which types and values you
want revealed to the user and which you would prefer to be hidden.

Once you have color.mli implemented, you should still be able to
compile color.ml and run color.byte.
......................................................................*)


(*......................................................................
Exercise 2C:

In the file color.ml, modify the implementation of a color module as
you see fit. Make the design choices that you think would be best for
a color module implementation. In particular, you should be able to
come up with a solution that is **much** clearer and more transparent
than the one currently in color.ml.

To pass the unit tests, you'll want the RGB values for the colors in
the color_name type to have the following values:

     R  |  G  |  B  | Color
    ----|-----|-----|--------
    255 |   0 |   0 | Red
      0 | 255 |   0 | Green
      0 |  0  | 255 | Blue
    255 | 165 |   0 | Orange
    255 | 255 |   0 | Yellow
     75 |   0 | 130 | Indigo
    240 | 130 | 240 | Violet

......................................................................*)


(* Here's the payoff: A user who uses the color module, by virtue of
having to stay within the color.mli interface, will not notice **any
difference at all** between the two implementations in color.ml. The
underlying implementation can be changed any time in any way, so long
as the functionality provided stays consistent with the signature.

For instance, consider the List module that you are familiar with by
now.  You never needed to worry about how the List module was
implemented in order to use it, you only needed to understand the
interface.

Compartmentalization ftw! *)
